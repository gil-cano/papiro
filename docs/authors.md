[Lexers](https://training.plone.org/contributing/authors.html#choosing-a-lexer)

> Some lexers are less than perfect. If your code block does not highlight well, then consider specifying a less ambitious lexer, such as `text`.

> Use `shell` for commands to be issued in a terminal session. Do not include shell prompts. This will make commands easy to copy and paste for readers.

> Use `console` for output of a shell session. If you have a mix of a shell command and its output, then use `console`.
